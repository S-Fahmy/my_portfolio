            Aviram is a web application powered by an Image recognition AI model
            aimed towards photographers with different features to help them
            store, sort and group similar looking images, visual search images,
            picking their favorite images from different gallery sets and Select
            and share images with others to vote on their favorites.

      <h2>MY ROLE:</h2>
      <p>
        We were a team of 2, a machine learning developer and me as the
        fullstack web developer where i had the opportunity to plan and develop
        multiple important features.
      </p>

      <h2>CHALLENGES:</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">
        When I first started on this project the AI model and backend API ran in
        an unoptimized way that took a long time to load up gallery sets, so a
        better and more optimized solution needed to be implemented.

        <br />
        <br />
        I took the responsibility to plan and implement an optimized
        multi-processed workflow for the API and the AI model to do their job,
        and persist only the needed AI output data to be loaded quicker on
        demand. So now when a user opens up a big gallery that he just uploaded
        or a shared gallery made by another user, the needed AI data loads up in
        a quick and smooth way. This workflow is done on multiple background
        steps and uses the <span class="bold-white">GC tasks API </span> and
        <span class="bold-white"> GC storage </span> services. I have
        implemented a logging feature and error checking, for reliability.

          <p class="m-auto">
            on the gallery page, Users are meant to view all of the images
            gallery on one page, meaning there was no multi-page pagination on
            purpose, and gallery pages are considerably long.
            <br /><br />
            To solve this I was asked to design and implement a custom gallery
            minimap that fits the different gallery layouts (normal, sorted and
            grouped, stacked, favorites and shared images layouts).

            There are more features that i have built like favoriting images,
            grouping and stacking similar images, searching by images, gallery
            images selections, sharing with none registered users and voting
            functionalities.
